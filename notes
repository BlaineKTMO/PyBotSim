Description:
    Python differential drive robot simulator with an included LiDAR. Features
    to scale movement and adjustable parameters.

=== 3/20/23 ===
Problems:
    Anaconda initialized python to 2.7. Spent 30-60min trying to debug pygame
    images.

    Issues with getting a set fps, and timing the game loop. Currently doing a 
    hack where lidar laserscan only happens every 20 loops.
    ^^^ Maybe try splitting up lidar scan across all 20 loops
    
    Issues with LiDAR computations taking too long. Already replaced square and
    square root with incremental addition - some benefit
    
Good stuff:
    Was really easy to get started and progress was made quickly. Was able to 
    add driving robot, path, lidar attachment, laserscan functionality, and
    some wall functionality.

To Do:
    Documentation
    Try numpy arrays to get C to do the number crunching
    Resize wall dimensions to lower load and find texture.

Problems:
    Really weird bugs with math. I need to go back through and double check all
    the math.

    Felt the pain of some poor design choices in the beginning. Need to refactor
    code soon.

Good stuff:
    Improved performance with lidar considerably. Changed approach from
    simulating individual beams to simulating radial expansion, and checking for
    collisions. This allows us to simultaneously check multiple beams rather
    than iterating through all of them.

To Do:
    Refactor
